At least in Missouri.A little bit of discount for a year\'s old model but major functions are pretty much the same.Camera quality is amazingCharges wellGood storageDual SIMValue for moneyI really wanted the S23 Ultra because I like the curved edges, which my old phone also had, but no phone carrier or store had them in stock. I was nervous about ordering a phone off Amazon, but my order came fast, in the factory packaging, with no issues and a nice little gift (a charger) from the seller. Plus, the phone is everything I wanted: battery lasts for days, tons of storage, simple to transfer data from my old Galaxy, and charges quickly. All I had to do to set it up was transfer the SIM card. Overall, great buy.I wrote a review earlier BUT I did not know a charger did not come with the cell phone.  Normally a SIM Card is included but it was not.  The small items that should be include are not.  My delivery read left in mailbox; ""NO"" the box (Too large for the mailbox) and my mail was left on the front porch.  Also, the charge is not included.  Basically, you\'re just'",Overall_Sentiment='Positive' Review_Aggressiveness=3
