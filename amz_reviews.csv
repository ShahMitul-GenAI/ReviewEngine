49,Fsmf216,5,I am forever married to Samsung Galaxies all the way. To me they are the best and last the longest
48,James,5,Uncomplicated and the right size for her hands. It has the features that my wife would normally use. She loves the Galaxy S 23 FE
47,Amanda Schroyer,5,"We got this for my son, and so far it has worked out amazing. This one doesn't break as easily as all of the others he has had. If you add a case your really covered good! This phone is very user friendly, inexpensive, and the battery lasts a long time. The fingerprint sensor works perfect."
46,Digigear,5,"It's heavier and a bit thicker than my Moto G which I had to replace due to broken screen. Wasn't worth fixing. It feels solid, dropped a couple of times and it survived, thankfully. Picture quality is awesome.Be warned, it does not have a headphone jack. Wish it did so that I could connect it to radios which do not have Bluetooth.Also, could not get the provider I wanted because their system did not have this on approved list yet. Had to choose another provider (Visible by Verizon.) ATT & Verizon recognized it with no issues. But, Spectrum did not (that's the one I wanted), neither did Metro PCS (T-Mobile), which both companies did sell the exact phone at a higher price, weird.Definitely faster than my old Moto G Stylus (2020), I can browse much easier and faster. And, the apps load up faster. I just think it's a bit too expensive for what it is.I maybe expecting too much, but battery life seems wanting. I really didn't put it to a formal test, but during the first days of setting up the phone I had to charge it a lot. Even now, I have to charge it once a day, and I mainly use it for using the apps to do minimal work. So, take my rating on battery life with a grain of a salt."
45,PhilD,5,"Just to begin, the phone is awesome. Be carefully with what phone service provider you want to use the phone with. SPECTRUM is a pain in the a$$. I went to the store with this ""3rd party phone"". They said that the phone is NOT compatible with Spectrum's system. I know... it is unlocked and should work on any provider. In essence, if you didn't buy it here, we won't put it on our system. Don't give up. Leave the store and call ""611"". For some ungodly reason, the managent won't let the stores put phones not purchased with Spectrum on their system. Call 611."
44,Jovindio,5,"I got this phone on sale for $400 (Black Friday 2023). So far, it's been very good for the price. The chipset is simply blazing fast. Everything feels snappy on this phone. Opening and closing apps are quick. Animation is smooth and does not stutter. The build quality is amazing and feels good to touch. So good that I did not use case until I first dropped it (more on this later).One drawback this phone has is battery life. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 processor is power hungry. The battery, while theoretically big, is quickly depleted. I mostly use my phone for navigation (Android Auto wireless), YouTube video playback, browsing on Edge, or social media chatting. My Screen on Time (SoT) life is expected to be 7 hours when fully charged according to AccuBattery Pro app I installed since day one of owning this phone. That is my usage without gaming ever. Expect the battery life to go down to around 4 hours or even less if you game because gaming is extremely taxing on your phone. It also heats up quite quickly, probably because it's drawing a bit too much power than it should have (inefficient CPU / GPU). One solution I have working for me is by activating Light performance profile under Device Care settings. This decrease the performance unless you're gaming. For my use case, it's perfect because it doesn't overheat anymore. That 7 hours SoT figure is with this profile turned on. Expect it to be around 5.5 to 6 hours SoT without this on.So about me dropping the phone, it was when I was changing my car's tires. I was crouching, so when it fell, it was about 12 inches high. The floor was concrete, and it was not clean. This is the worst combination because dust and debris are really abrasive and can easily put lots of dents and scratches on phone. Surprisingly, other than two scratches (one big, and one small), there's really no other damage. I was using matte screen protector at that time, so when it ended up falling screen down, it did crack the screen protector, but the screen remains flawless to this day. I assumed it fell by its side frame (charging port side), then it fell face down. I did attach the photo so you can judge the amount of damage done by this accident."
43,Allan,5,Happy with my purchase good value for money.
42,Isaac,5,"I'm pleased to report that the phone I received is exactly what I ordered - a brand new s23 fan edition device that arrived overnight and on time. The phone was unopened and in its original package, cellophane wrapped and factory fresh. It's in tip-top shape, clean, sharp, and practically perfect with a pretty purple shine. I'm impressed with how well-made it is, and it's fairly priced too - way less expensive than the flagship.  The phone comes with a SIM slot key and a C-to-C cable. However, I'm not sure if it has an expandable memory slot. At the moment, it doesn't seem to have a keyhole for the memory slot, but it does have one for the SIM slot. I also purchased a protective case separately, which is clear, decent, and fits well in my hand and pocket. Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase and would recommend this phone to anyone looking for a high-quality device at a reasonable price."
41,Jeffrey Doerr,5,"This S23FE was a great upgrade from my S9. Easy to import all of my contacts, apps, photo's & files. It took some time using the smart swith app for Android as I had thousands of photos but was all done in the app. It's much faster than the S9 but the easy to use of the android system. It is totally unlocked as advertised and connected to the Verizon network right away. FYI: get a new sim card rather than using your old phones existing sim card. The only issue I ran into was by using my S9 sim card it was registered to the old phone and discovered it was in the new S23fe which it didn't like. It stopped communicating with verizon. The techs at verizon fixed everything quickly and it now works perfectly all at no charge! The camera portion of the phone takes ok selfies and basic photographs. The zoom feature came out a little blurry. Not the best camera setup but the phone/texting and all apps function as desired. All in all I'm totally satisfied with the newest Galaxy model plus saved over $100 by purchasing online. Samsung quality."
40,Melanie H,5,"Update; Received refund the day after I posted my review.  Changed from 3 stars to an 5 star.Ordered this new phone as hubster's replacement phone.  We had been searching for a while for just the right one, has great reviews and a fantastic price. We received the original order quickly, charged it and started the set up. The phone needed a PIN to log in and set up. We thought this was unusual for a new phone. Started a chat session w/Amazon Help Desk and w/in 5 minutes was told that it appeared to have been used by a customer, returned the item and we ended up receiving it in error.  We were offered the return option so that we could purchase another one. We initiated the return process and mailed it out the next day.  The return message on my Amazon account stated that we would be refunded when they received the device. I have been monitoring my emails and still have not received any notice or tracking info.  I checked the tracking number thru UPS and it shows that the device was received 2 days ago.  I logged into my Amazon account and the Refund Status shows the same info but I am not scheduled for my $500+ refund until more than 2 weeks away. Why would it take that long and why would they indicate that my refund would be issued upon their receipt? Very frustrating!  The new device was easy to set up, long lasting battery, superb camera."
34,Autumn,4,"The black Friday deal was definitely worth it. It's a great phone, especially if you're looking for an affordable upgrade. Feels premium and not too costly to obtain. The cameras & battery life are great. What I like most is that its not ""curved"" but actually square with smooth edges- its easy to hold and grip. It's easy to interact with, up to date, transferring everything is simple. Very similar in size to a S22+, the weight may seem heavy to some. I appreciate how this was made. The only con is it comes with a USB-C to USB-C cable, meaning you have to buy a USB-C charger cube/box if you don't already have one since it's a USB-C type of charger. If you're used to the older charger types you can easily find a cable that connects to the charger cube/box but has a USB-C end on the other end of the charger."
30,TWilliams,4,"ProsBeautiful classic design, dual-glass, IP68-rated.Fast OLED screen, decent brightness, great color accuracy, HDR10+.Very good stereo speakers.Flagship-grade performance.Reliable camera quality across the board.ConsIt's closer related to S22 than S23Heavy weight, thick screens bezels -_-Battery life could be better"
31,Jordan,4,"Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because it doesn't come with a block, and the charger it comes with could be significantly better otherwise; it seems to be an amazing phone off the rip. I just switched back to android after years of being with Apple I got tired of my phone being outdated so quickly and the lack of user customization. I was looking at this phone for a bit because I wanted a galaxy and in the past my old androids when I was young would slow down and lag after a week of use. I haven't had this one for even a week yet but it's clearing all my worries thus far. My first worry was will it really be ""unlocked"" or will I have to go through a series of emails and returns to get one that accepts my Sim. Nope, popped my Sim in from my iPhone xr (I use cricket) it prompted me to restart the device so it could configure to it and boom. It even auto went to 5g shortly after (xr doesn't support 5g). There's that, I was also worried it would lag or skip like the cheaper androids I assume I had when I was younger but, man, this thing is smooth! I did a bit of extensive research and I was debating between this and a used s23 at the same price but after much debate and the risks of buying a used phone no matter who the seller is I landed back here and I don't regret it. All the good features as the flagships and none of the useless ones at half the price. Battery seems great thus far, just know that with every phone if you treat the battery with no care it will degrade so do a little research. Condition was amazing. Came packed in a loose box kind of but the phones packaging itself that was inside the box won't let anything happen to it. My only tip is buy a case when you buy the phone, it's very smooth and nice but also slippery and will fall out your pocket very easily between motions so keep that in mind. Hope I helped! (Make sure to select the version that comes with the free $100 Amazon gift card while it lasts)💪🏽"
32,Bryan,4,"Battery life is good, calls are clear, I have no issues with heat or the processor.The screen could be better my old s8 was 564pi, the s23fe is lower around 403.Buy a case."
33,Redjan,4,I got this phone supposedly because of its high rating. And I am very disappointed in it. I do not like the Text-to-speech on my messenger. It doesn't pick up all the words correctly. It doesn't have the bells and whistles like my Motorola phone had. I'm stuck with it now for a couple of years UNFORTUNATELY.  The only thing I like better is the camera feature.
38,Gloworm,4,"I love this phone. But I dropped 1 star because on the regular texting app, they got rid of the delivered/read receipt and also the video calling like the Galaxy 8 and 9 has (our old phones).  The size is great and love how the fingerprint is on the front screen. So far, so good!"
35,Ankoru Nakamura,4,Esta bastante bien lo único que no me gusto es que la batería no le dura casi
36,Van,4,"I bought this on Black Friday for $400 and at that price the S23 FE is definitely worth it. The Snapdragon processor can definitely keep up with the adaptive refresh rate up to 120 Hz. This phone can handle most games you throw at it without a noticeable drop in FPS. The camera is sharper compared to Samsung's A series line. The smaller battery is noticeable here so expect to charge your phone more often but it does support 25W fast charging. This phone does get warm after prolong and extensive use but I use a phone case so it doesn't bother me. There is no headphone jack, no charging block included, or expandable storage which stops it from being 5 stars. Overall though, this is a great budget phone if you don't want to pay flagship prices but still get 80% of the features of a flagship phone."
37,Ray Olatubi,4,Purchased the phone a month ago.  Initially had a problem with the settings.  Called the tech support number and the issue was resolved immediately.  Defintely great service from a company that stands behind their product.
39,Jonathan,4,"I am not impressed.  I had the Galaxy S20 FE.  My son has it now.  There is literally not enough difference between the 2.  I have learned my lesson. I will basically run this one into the ground before I ""upgrade"" again.  The battery life on my brand new phone is no better than my 2 year old S20 FE.  Perhaps the camera is better. I cannot really tell."
26,Slick 1,3,Lots of glitching & different settings not found on Samsungs website....?
29,Deon Keyser,3,The unit arrived with any means to charge it.  No charging unit and no appropriate cable.I should have read more thoroughly.Also no headphone jack.  This is a pain since I am hard of hearing.The changes in selection of apps will take some getting used to.  Not easy to find your way around.
28,Snm,3,"wait, I forgot the other thing! 1 month after purchase it kept disconnecting to home wifi. It wont let me mute text notifications so every 30 secs I get a popup bc the MTA texted me about a late train! Volume on high is quite low and poor sound quality. No memory card slot. Very long device. Camera in selfie mode makes me stay still for 3 seconds before snapping the pic! Cant figure how to turn that off! If phone is turned off you wont hear alarms. Fingerprint recognition poor. And Amazon tacked on the cost of a ""$100 gift card"" that I assumed I was getting for free, making the phone normal retail cost. Depective"
27,Susan Vang,3,Battery life ain't so great. Love everything about it though!!! & here's a full moon shot for those who are curious.
25,Devon Spencer,3,"Three stars just for the price and battery life. The battery is manageable for me, but plan on charging it at least once a day, and very rarely twice. This is only after a month, I cant imagine the batteries depreciated this quickly. The phone doesnt run hot, I can play most games (minecraft is a little bit of a struggle), I like the screen, and the cameras are okay. I bought it fairly cheap for black friday, but I would argue this is a $350 phone. Don't regret it, but there's better options."
23,M Houston,3,The phone looks great and has great features; however the battery life is lackluster.
22,Valon Zayas,3,With All Exaggeration Aside I'd Rather Do Battle with A Vicious Mountain Lion In The Handicap Stall Of A Local McDonald's With My Hands Tied Behind My Back And A Shake Weight Strapped To My Forehead As My Only Viable Weapon Than Ever Use This Phone A Day Longer.
21,Joe Burnham,3,"I bought my 23 FE near the end of 2023, and was very happy with it till recently.  I originally went to the Comcast store, and had them do a SIM swap from my previous phone.  All was OK till about a month ago, when I realized I had not been receiving voicemails.I was told that this phone (unless bought from Comcast) is NOT 100 percent compatible with their network, and that some features would stop working after a while.  This is exactly what happened to me.  So, if the ability to receive voicemail is important to you, do NOT buy this phone if you plan on using  it on the Comcast network."
20,Gojira,3,"Overall, the phone is average, but the battery life is very disappointing. I've searched online, and other people have the same issue. It is apparently due to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen1 (SM8450) being terrible for battery life. Even the normal Samsung Galaxy S23 phones (which were released before the Galaxy S23 FE) use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen2 (SM8550), which is insanely better. Why they didn't decide to use it on this phone (which is newer) is beyond me. It was a terrible mistake on Samsung's part, in my opinion. There's no excuse for using a 2-year-old processor from your S22 lineup for a phone that was just released. Having a 4500mAh battery means nothing when the power-hungry CPU is sucking the life out of it. The battery of my 8-year-old Samsung Galaxy S9 is comparable to this phone, which is new out of the box and fully charged with dark mode and a dim screen. You are better off buying a phone with a processor that doesn't suck the battery life out of it like a vampire. Cheaping out and having such poor battery life is unacceptable in 2024."
24,Andy,3,"The phone is fast and snappy. I have no complaints about that. What I don't like are the sharp edges that make it uncomfy to hold but that can be fixed with a case. You can't fix the weight though, this thing is on a little on the heavy side. Subjective opinion incoming but the bezels are thin enough that i have accidental touches on the screen so I wish the bezels are a little bigger. I also have a problem with the youtube app where I'm double tapping the left side of the video to rewind a few seconds back but it sometimes does not register the taps which is really annoying and not sure if its an issue with the screen or software. Cameras are ok, overall I think this phone is good if you can get it for $450 or less"
13,Sven Golly,2,"Without a case, this phone has to be the worst I've held of any modern smartphone. The aluminum frame has a relatively sharp edge where it meets the screen and back of the phone. This makes it very uncomfortable to hold. To top it off, the back is really slippery and shiny with no texture making it a slip and fingerprint magnet. With a case, the phone turns into a oversized monster.Next, the Samsung apps basically duplicate everything that stock Google Android provides. Specifically, messaging, calendar, contacts, files, etc. don't really benefit from Samsung's re-hash. Coming from a relatively stock Android experience, all the clutter just makes no sense to me.Finally, the cameras are nothing special and the image quality is very mid-range. I thought it would be S23 class but it's more like the A54.I returned it after 4 days of use. I'm still waiting for Amazon to refund me after more than 3 weeks (also disappointing since they promised 3-5 business days)."
14,Carolyn Barrett,2,The last software update seriously downgraded my phone. I loved my s23 fe until that update lost so many options in my settings that I used.
10,Linda in Dixie,2,"I finally HAD to replace my old Samsung Galaxy as it was having major issues & wasn't supported anymore. To be clear about this S23 FE, it is a tablet with phone capabilities, to call it a cell phone is misleading. Since I am not a techie & any directions from Samsung are pretty much non-existent it was a nightmare to get up & running & to have any confidence I hadn't just opened up all my information to anyone who could access it. That reminds me, I need to go back in and erase the passwords for my banking and credit cards that it so nicely downloaded. I got not just one migraine headache, I had two before I was finished. Using a fingerprint is just a sick joke, when I FINALLY  got one to scan that the Galaxy accepted, the print wouldn't work so after 10 or 20 tries I gave up and went back to a password but not before I got locked out once again for trying too many times. And on and on and on it went 'till I finally went through the system and turned off all the junk I knew I'd never use and all the very invasive crap that comes as part of a new system. Don't people know how to think anymore, AI can't take over everything & hopefully I'll be dead before it does. I am sorry I bought this thing.  EDIT: I returned it"
11,Terry Dunning,2,"After having my Galaxy S8+ for 6 years I found this phone to be a major disappointment! The Galaxy S8+ felt great in my hand it was wonderful to hold. The S23 FE Feels like a thin brick. The lack of a notification light on the screen when the phone screen is off is a major disappointment. Neither of the two phones I bought responds well to the touch screen, and I don't have screen protectors on either. Personally, I can't wait to replace this phone with one that's got the features that I miss from my old phone and feels better to hold. That said, the camera is great! But I miss the ability to expand the memory. It wasn't worth the money I saved."
12,Band Man,2,"I had an S8 before this, an old cheap phone. I thought I was getting a new, top of thr line phone with the S23. The S23 has less features than the S8. It is very glitchy and it easily butt dials. It doesn't even have an 1/8 inch jack. The only benefit of this is the extra storage."
16,Chuck,2,This Phone has no way to use an SD card for transporting video and the voice to text does not work well
15,richardbuzzell,2,"Bought this phone in February for my daughter in  law. After one month of use the phone started to act up. Sometimes she sound like she's under water. The keyboard doesn,t work half the time. The same issues she had with her previous model is now happening to this one. Samsung has to do a lot better especially for the price."
17,M D,2,"A few issues, the camera lenses stick out so the phone will not lay flat. What a ridiculous design. Had to buy a really thick case to level it. Next, what is Samsung thinking? This new S23 FE model does not allow you to delete multiple texts at one time, you have to delete every text individually...are they for real? I googled and went to YouTube to see if I was missing something, you cannot do it on this FE model."
18,iulian dinu,2,"Changed to s23fe from s20fe mostly because of the price, updates, camera and battery. Price is good and the phone is fast. Camera is better than my old phone.That's about it. Its bulky and heavier than the s20fe, uncomfortable in my pocket, feels like i am carrying a brick. Battery life is not so great as advertised. For the $399 i paid it's okay but less than i expected from a phone that was just released. Will wait for s24 and turn it in for an upgrade. I'd give it 2.5 stars.L.E The s24 ultra opened pre-orders but you cannot trade in s23fe which is a lemon. Day by dayi find new issues with this one."
19,William C,2,I am still evaluating this phone. I feel like I should get another one already. I will review again soon.
5,MB,1,"I just got this phone a month ago and I've already noticed a lot of issues. Sometimes calls won't go through, chargers won't work, and slow loading times. Idk if it's this specific phone being defective or if it's this model of phone but be careful.Edit: I noticed the charger problem has to be with my phone specifically because it looks like there's some kind of corrosion on the metal, there's blue/green spots on it. I'm trying to work with customer service to get a replacement but it's not panning out. I tried taking a picture, you can see the discoloration."
2,Joe,1,"I got this phone for my wife on a black friday sale and ever since she got it, its been have an unusual number of dropped and missed calls.  I called my carrier and points to hardware.  Then when i contact samsung, they had me go to local repair center but they said it was not repairable.  I was told then to try the mail in repair.  This is one major disvantage with purchasing directly from the hardware manufacturer.  You man need to send the phone in for 11 to 13 business days.  That is nearly a month.  This is a nightmare.  I thought samsung was a good company but this experience has soured me....do you do not get what you pay for..."
3,Mona,1,I absolutely hate this phone. The battery is sucked out within hours even when just sitting in table and gets hot. Sometimes it gets stuck for a few seconds. I I'm returning it as soon as I find another phone. Not worth $600 it has a bunch of apps on it that I do not want but scard if I delete them says could mess up the phone if you delete them. I'm old and want a nice last new phone not not second hand and this phone is not worth it. It will take a week or more now to get my money back
4,Life,1,"I had to replace Huawei mate 9 after hadused it perfectly for the past 7 years , because no new version of Google service to support few apps that I have to use daily. This Samsung Galaxy phone has the apps that I need but it is so so frustrating to see software messed up a lot and the battery lasts so short that I have to charge it again and again during the mid of conference call, it does not have warning sign before it turned off. It is no better than mate 9 other than able to use the most updated version of Google Play store. I am so disappointed that I had no choice other than return this phone back to Amazon. Wish Samsung S 24 Ultra do better."
1,Kim Schumacher,1,"I specifically asked my mobile carrier(Spectrum mobile) if the phone would work with their service before purchasing. They stated that if it said it was unlocked it would work with their service. I ordered the phone expecting to set it up and be good to go. The Spectrum rep started transferring info to the phone only to find that it wouldn't work. They looked into it more to find that it wasn't actually unlocked. They stated that this happens with Samsung's newer phones sometimes. I got home and started an online chat with Samsung and they had me make an appointment with a certified Samsung repair place to supposedly unlock the phone. When I got to the repair place they told me that they had no idea why they would send me to them and that they can't unlock a phone. Just wonderful that they wasted even more of my time!! I was able to return the phone with amazon, but of course even with prime I was charged for shipping....not the  biggest issue, but still an aggravation! I have been a loyal Samsung customer and still like the products, but I will never buy another phone online after having to waste so much time dealing with this. Don't get fooled by the cheaper price. Just a follow up, Amazon has decided to take their sweet @ss time returning my money. they have received the phone over 2 weeks ago and by the timeline they show, I might get the money refunded by Christmas. Ridiculous!"
6,Snake Pliskin,1,The delivery driver stole this and I had to go through an absolute nightmare with Amazon customer service to get my money back.  Most frustrating experience of my entire life.  I will never place a high value order with Amazon again in my life.
7,Arame Iskandaryan,1,"I bought it one month ago, and it’s already had a lot of problems, I can’t hear call unless I turn on speaker. It’s take a screenshot of the phone every time I am opening it. I want refund or change."
8,sake,1,i bought this phone using monthly payment method. it was meant to be a gift for my mom. when she went to set everything up with xfinity mobile. they told her that its not compatible with xfinity mobile. she doesnt wanna switch to another mobile provider cause then we would have to pay more for our phone plan. ill be returning the phone to amazon
9,mandy w.,1,"I bought this phone on black friday and while it is ""unlocked"" it is an internationally unlocked version that ATT says they cannot use on their network.  Needless to say, the phone had to be returned and that was a whole other challenge on its own.  Be super careful when buying this ""unlocked"" item!"
0,JSTYLES & CO.,1,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, Allow me to help you with buyer's remorse here. I genuinely care and will help prevent your migraines, you throwing this phone across the room, toss it through the window,  or perhaps drive over it. This Samsung s23fe should be recalled. I'm so appalled that this nearly $500.00 didn't even come close to my beloved ""LG G8 THINQ"" PLEASE LG COME BACK!!!  Anyways,  I do want to caution you that the ""Fingerprint"" Scanner will stop working after a few weeks. I done every trouble shooting you can imagine. Samsung is definitely aware of it but there taking there sweet time in finding a resolution.  The speed does fluctuate from time to time. There are moments it's blazing fast and moments it's in dire need of CPR. Have you noticed window scrolling hopping? And your scrolling through or reading it the screen slows down and sketches. Absolutely disappointing!  Let's not talk about the battery life because if I do I'm going to really miss my LG G8 THINQ. Battery life scenario: I fully charge it and I work a 10 hour shift, I rarely make phone calls and I'm at 72 to 75 percent. My LG was stable at 90 -92%. And again I'm not even making calls. Just casually will look and return text messages. Yes I did infact return it. SAMSUNG should recall this phone model."
