With the s24 issues, I wanted to replace my s23 ultra with the same.  Asurion is back-ordered so far they offered to pay me cash value.  So this is the direction I went.The problems weren't apparent until I tried to cut the SIM and LTE service over.  What you'll find with this device in the package is a card telling you the APN settings you'll need to apply.  This is where issues start however, that you couldn't save/apply the settings you were given - the apn registry will just disappear and you'd be left with CDMA apn only.  To keep the explanation simple I spent hours researching and playing with APN settings to no avail.  Voice service worked with the default APN settings that were registered to the SIM card, but SMS and MMS wouldn't.  Well in today's world of 2 factor Auth that's not good - especially since I've already registered most of 2FA to use SMS to my number.So I go to a Verizon store and spend 4 hours before the Superbowl trying to figure it out, adding new SIM(s)/ESIM(s) and nothing will get SMS to work.  I then realize that my watch LTE is not working either and we can't activate that due to the line sharing.  So we deactivate my line and attempt to re-activate each separately, and now my watch is the only one with service at all.  VZ tier 3 figures out a way to remove my account entirely from VZ network and re-add, and then I have a working watch LTE and phone except it's SMS only.  No MMS, no texts working to iPhone users, and super spotty coverage.  Eventually VZ decides to do a CLNR (certified like new replacement) to me for all this trouble.  BAM, this one works immediately with 0 issues.  Something about this global model and the service bands it uses caused serious troubles for me.If you're looking for a phone that handles basic SMS and LTE, then this does ok.  You just won't get mms to work domestic USA.  Also, Dual SIM won't work in US to run 2 lines, but you should be able to activate the second SIM on other country's providers.\"}, {'customer_name': 'Frankybigguns', 'rating': 2, 'review': \"This phone is PERFECT if you plan to move overseas, however if you intend to use it in the US keep in mind that this phone will not be covered under Samsung's USA warranty. Furthermore, there are a number of networks that will NOT work with this phone such as Cricket, US wireless, Boost mobile, and a few others. Because of this, my phone received a very weak signal and I could barely hear or talk to any one I dialed. I ended up returning this and am still waiting for my refund and decided I would just go with official phones sold from Samsung, Google, and/or Best Buy.EDIT: Seller refunded me about a week after sending back. I wanted to add that the phone functioned just fine outside of cell signal reception and WIFI calling functioned flawlessly. However due to the region lock which I could not swap APNs on (including downloading the software), the Singaporean government app installed itself onto the phone for which I could not delete (I could delete it but it would come right back). Added 1 star because the phone functions fine and the seller was gracious in returns, but being unable to unlock the region/change APNs and the limitations in US carriers keeps my overall rating below average. Your mileage will vary...\"}, {'customer_name': 'Abe', 'rating': 2, 'review': 'Iove this phone so far, but beware you will not be eligible for Samsung care+.

At least in Missouri.A little bit of discount for a year\\'s old model but major functions are pretty much the same.Camera quality is amazingCharges wellGood storageDual SIMValue for moneyI really wanted the S23 Ultra because I like the curved edges, which my old phone also had, but no phone carrier or store had them in stock. I was nervous about ordering a phone off Amazon, but my order came fast, in the factory packaging, with no issues and a nice little gift (a charger) from the seller. Plus, the phone is everything I wanted: battery lasts for days, tons of storage, simple to transfer data from my old Galaxy, and charges quickly. All I had to do to set it up was transfer the SIM card. Overall, great buy.I wrote a review earlier BUT I did not know a charger did not come with the cell phone.  Normally a SIM Card is included but it was not.  The small items that should be include are not.  My delivery read left in mailbox; \"NO\" the box (Too large for the mailbox) and my mail was left on the front porch.  Also, the charge is not included.  Basically, you\\'re just'), Document(page_content='getting the phone with no SIM Card and the basic Charger.The cell is a great phone.Upon opening the package, I read the introduction card, which states \"This phone is Not compatible with Cricket Wireless.\" So I returned it. I should have simply installed my Cricket Sim, and it probably would have worked fine like my daughters. Live and learn.I thought i commented regarding this phone already, neway, good phone the first day i powered this up it got a bit warm but since then its been about a month i dont have any complaints at all. Highly recommendNo trae cables necesario para la carga de bateríaAfter my husband screen broke and used our warranty to get a nothing one. Instead of upgrading we love this phone so much we keep with it. We haven\\'t had any issues with this phone and would give this one 10 stars.After Having Iphone for almost 10 years I decided it was time for a change and haven\\'t look back since. I love the S Pen everything about this phone there is only one down fall this phone doesn\\'t run on 5G UC only on 5G. Other than that I love this purchase!What to say?  It\\'s great!Celular nuevo, sellado, con todos cable tipo C, manuales y herramienta para extraer SIM.Celular con')]\n"
